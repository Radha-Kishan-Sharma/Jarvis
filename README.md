# Jarvis

## Overview:
The Python-based Jarvis Virtual Assistant is a personal project inspired by fictional AI assistants like Tony Stark's Jarvis. 
It harnesses the power of Python programming and various libraries to create a voice-controlled assistant capable of performing tasks and providing information.

## Key Features:

#### Voice Recognition: Utilizes libraries such as speech_recognition to understand voice commands.
#### Natural Language Processing (NLP): Implements NLP libraries like nltk or spaCy for interpreting and processing user queries.
#### Task Automation: Executes tasks based on user commands, such as retrieving weather information, setting reminders, sending emails, or controlling smart devices.
#### Information Retrieval: Fetches real-time data from APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for news updates, weather forecasts, or other requested information.
#### Interactive Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for interaction, including text-to-speech synthesis to respond to queries audibly.
#### Customization: Allows customization through the addition of new functionalities or integration with third-party services.

## Technologies Used:

#### Python: Core programming language for development.
#### Speech Recognition Libraries: speech_recognition for voice input.
#### Text-to-Speech (TTS) Libraries: Provides audible responses using libraries like pyttsx3 or gTTS.
#### APIs and Web Services : 
##### WolframAlpha: For performing calculations and answering complex queries.
##### Wikipedia: For retrieving information from Wikipedia.
##### Google Search: For performing web searches.
##### YouTube: For searching and playing videos.
